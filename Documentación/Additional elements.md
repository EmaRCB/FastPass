## Programming language

Speaking of the programming language used, this is different from what is normally carried with the course. Using Python instead of Java served us in several ways. 

Our abstraction of object-oriented programming concepts improved, as we felt we were able to implement what we saw regardless of the language used.

The clear improvement is that we now have a better understanding of the Python language. This also makes us reflect on the advantages/disadvantages of using one programming language or another.
