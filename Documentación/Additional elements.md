# Additional elements

## Programming language

Speaking of the programming language used, this is different from what is normally carried with the course. Using Python instead of Java served us in several ways. 

Our abstraction of object-oriented programming concepts improved, as we felt we were able to implement what we saw regardless of the language used.

The clear improvement is that we now have a better understanding of the Python language. This also makes us reflect on the advantages/disadvantages of using one programming language or another.

## UptimeRobot

UptimeRobot was one of the most interesting additional elements we discovered. On that page you can monitor from websites, to bots. 

By monitoring we mean seeing the requests you receive, the state of the site, if it falls, or there is a problem. The best part is that itâ€™s totally free,

## Discord.py knowledge

Overall working with the project gave us a lot of knowledge about something we commonly interact with, the discord bots.


One of the additional elements that we rescued from this is the use of a very specific function, the requests function, to put it in simple terms is a function that allows you to make requests to websites. We discovered interesting things such as the behavior of the parameters in a link using this function and the utilities it has.
