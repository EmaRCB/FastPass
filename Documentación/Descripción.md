# Description of the Project

## General objective
Develop a bot for the "Discord" instant messaging platform that complements the "eldorado.gg" platform, specifically, its section for the sale of accounts for different video games, where the user is able to search in Discord for accounts of different games with certain specifications and, that the bot generates the link where the accounts are hosted, based on certain conditions specified in the command entered. Finally, the bot returns to the user, in the form of a message, the link of the found accounts.


## Specific objectives
- Launch a free tool of great quality, that complements the platform eldorado.gg bringing it closer to the environment of the public of Discord, to which this project is directed.
- Bring the transaction of accounts to Discord, when invoking the bot in any server, facilitating the task to anyone who uses it to find an account in sale that satisfies the requirements that the user requests, by generating a link.
- Create reliable buying-selling links between users of different games.

## Types of users
- Any Discord user who is interested in purchasing an account for any of the games available and wants to do so from their server.

## Innovation
- Discord is a platform that has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, being an essential tool for any video game fan who enjoys playing with friends, or finding communities with whom to talk about their favorite games. More and more bots are being implemented with new and better functionalities, which seek to improve the user experience with different actions. The account market is a recent market with a large expansion window, and we seek to give users a simple experience in purchasing these, from the comfort of their favorite server.
