# Work Process

### Methodology:
SCRUM.

The SCRUM methodology is a process in which a set of tasks are carried out on a regular basis with the main objective of working collaboratively. In short... teamwork in an organized way.

The characteristics of this methodology are 3:
- Transparency: Everyone knows what is happening with the project at all times.
- Inspection: Members of the Scrum team frequently inspect progress to detect potential problems.
- Adaptation: When there is something to change, the team comes together to achieve the goal.

Taking into account the above mentioned proposal to implement the SCRUM methodology to our project is:

Each sprint will last one week. The end of each sprint (sprint review) will be after the weekly meeting with Dr. Edgar Cambranes.

The sprint planning will be done one day after the meeting with Dr. Edgar Cambranes. The duration will be a maximum of one hour. The result of this meeting will be the sprint goal and the sprint backlog.

The daily meeting will take place every working day of the week. It is expected that the duration of these will be, at most, 15 minutes. These meetings will discuss "what did I do yesterday?" "what will I do today?" and notify of possible impediments.

The retrospective sprint will be held as the last event to be held, this tentatively will take place after the last delivery.


Other observations regarding the methodology we will implement are: 

- Make use of the media chosen to comment on anything related to our project. This in order for everyone to know the direction this is always taking. Such comments are made when deemed relevant, there is no specific schedule to make them.
- All members shall make full revisions of the project at least once a week.
- In the event that any member detects a failure, or has a proposal to improve the project, they will discuss it either at a daily meeting or in the sprint planning.
- The sprint goal is the target for a sprint.
- The sprint backlog is the group of tasks that the development team chooses in the sprint planning together with the plan to be able to carry them out.
## Team roles
- Product owner: Flores Juárez Víctor
- Scrum master: Chavez Bagundo Emanuel
- Development team: Chavez Bagundo Emanuel, Maldonado Santiago Gildardo Adrián, Flores Juárez Víctor and Vargas Alonso Esteban.

## The media

The team will communicate via WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams and Discord applications respectively.
- WhatsApp: This application will be the main media of communication of the team, where all the meetings, changes, ideas and implementations that could be added to the project will be agreed.
- Microsoft Teams: For this application, weekly meetings will be held with the advisor/professor: Edgar Cambranes, to whom we will show our weekly advances of the project.
- Discord: This application will serve us as the main alternative for communication in case WhatsApp is out of service. Additionally, a server will be created in this application where we will observe the effectiveness of the bot.

## Instruments of work 
- Github
- Trello
- WhatsApp
- Microsoft Teams
- Replit
- Discord
- Discord Developer Portal
- UptimeRobot


## Methods and tools
- For the encoding of the bot, we will use Replit.
- For the operation of the bot, the "Discord" platform shall be used. Discord is the communication platform par excellence for many groups of people, including the "gamers", who are the main audience that our project will have. It is the platform where the interaction between the user and our bot will occur.
- Eldorado.gg is a platform to buy various elements related to video games, among its services we have: sale of objects for games, sale of accounts and boosting service. It is the platform that is intended to complement with our bot.
- UptimeRobot is a platform that will allow us to keep the bot active 24 hours a day. 
- Discord Developer Portal is the core of our bot, this is where we "register" the bot.


## Planning 
It will be planned on the basis of the team’s schedule of activities to have an objective of what is expected to be achieved in each of the project deliveries so that parts of the project need to be changed or removed as the project progresses. 
This planning will be carried out with the help of Trello, where the team board will have three sections:
- Pending: Where the remaining tasks will be found, using distinctive colors to identify the member to which the task belongs.
- Review: Tasks already performed but needed for reasons need review by other team members before being considered complete.
- Fact: Those tasks that have already been completed and are approved.  

In addition, team meetings will be held through the team platform to discuss the progress and needs of the project. This is to have a direct dialogue between the team’s schemers.
Monitoring
For activity monitoring, each team member will be given a specific activity needed during sprint planning. Once the activity has been done, the user will have to notify their colleagues, either at a daily meeting or during the sprint review. Since all the necessary activities are distributed, the product owner must order them in a document in the application [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/1znV3Ph3/2e82d0833387d8dcf2a1ffd1ef8e9d9d/fastpass), where there will be 3 sections: "Pending", "Needs revision" and "Finished". All activities will start in the pending section and, once completed, will be transferred to the section "Finished". In case you have doubts about an activity, the member in charge of it must move the activity to the "Needs review" section and announce it in the WhatsApp group, where the rest of the team will help to complete the task.
