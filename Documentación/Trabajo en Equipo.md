Monitoring
For activity monitoring, each team member will be given a specific activity needed during sprint planning. Once the activity has been done, the user will have to notify their colleagues, either at a daily meeting or during the sprint review. Since all the necessary activities are distributed, the product owner must order them in a document in the application [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/1znV3Ph3/2e82d0833387d8dcf2a1ffd1ef8e9d9d/fastpass), where there will be 3 sections: "Pending", "Needs revision" and "Finished". All activities will start in the pending section and, once completed, will be transferred to the section "Finished". In case you have doubts about an activity, the member in charge of it must move the activity to the "Needs review" section and announce it in the WhatsApp group, where the rest of the team will help to complete the task.

## Percentage of individual work defined
For the measurement of the defined individual work percentage we will use the shirt size method.
Subjectively as a team you assign the shirt size to each terea made so you have the amount of points achieved by each member. 

***The numerical mapping is:**

| Size | Points | 
| --- | --- |
| XS| 1 point |
| S | 2 points |
| M | 3 points |
| L | 5 points |
| XL | 8 points |


**Current contribution. Last updated: 11/25/2021***

**Total points:** 271 sts

***Emanuel Chávez:** 92 / 34.00%

***Victor Flores:** 101 / 37.5%

***Esteban Vargas:** 43 / 15.5%

***Gildardo Maldonado:** 35 / 13.0%



## Percentage of progress 
For the first delivery of project progress the required documentation was completed as had been stipulated in the project task planning, so as a team we determined that the project is 15.00% complete, because the programming part and its respective documentation are missing.
For the second advance installment of the project, most of the encoding part for the proper functioning of the bot was completed with the games: League of Legends and Fortnite. Likewise, the programming of the bot interaction with the user was completed. We determined that the project is 75% completed. It seeks to implement even more games available on the website "eldorado.gg".
