- Description: This date we met as a team in Discord to learn the basic configuration of a bot in Discord, we looked for information and we saw several tutorials and most show us that the easiest option to program the bot is with the language Python, so we decided as a team to start practicing this language individually and also perform test bots as seen in the videos and set a date next to start practicing as a team.
