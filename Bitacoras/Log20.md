- Description: On this date, we met as a team with the teacher to show the progress of our project. The attendees at this meeting were the members: Emanuel, Victor and Esteban. Gildardo didnâ€™t have to attend because of a scheduling clash, so we agreed to set a new schedule for our weekly meetings. At this meeting,  we reviewed the behavior of the functions, as well as the proposal to use dictionaries. He stayed to review the next session: Python classes, refactory and switch-case in Python.
