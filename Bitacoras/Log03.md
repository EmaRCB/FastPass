- Description: Today, we schedule a meeting with Professor Edgar Cambranes to discuss our projects. However, before starting the class, we decided that we would mainly present the idea of "PlayFast", which we decided to change the name to "FastPass". At the beginning of our meeting, we informed the teacher of the changes in the team and presented our project. After a brief positive feedback from the teacher, we decided to stay with the "FastPass" project and start working with it, discarding our second idea.
