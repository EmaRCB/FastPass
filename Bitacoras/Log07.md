- Description: During this day we present the use cases, the use case diagram and the class diagram of our project to the class and to the teacher Edgar Cambranes, who guided us to focus on a single video game in order to realize a more complete and focused project. As a team, it was discussed between Fortnite and League of leagends to be the video game we would use for the project. At the end it was established that we would work with League of Leagends.
