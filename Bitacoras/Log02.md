- Description: This day, as a team we received the request from Emanuel Ch√°vez to join the team, after a talk we decided to accept it because we thought that the more people we were, we would do a more efficient job. Later, we began to discuss ideas for the project, among which are: PlayFast, a bot for discord for the sale of various video game accounts. where the user calls the bot and enters their desired search, then the bot will search the database for an offer related to the desired one and, if found, presents it to the user and presents the data of the seller so that these 2 connect and carry out the transaction by themselves and Math-home, a browser home screen made especially for students of the faculty of Mathematics UADY, serve as a direct access to important sites for any UADY student and access to reliable sites to facilitate the search of information for students in an easy, fast and reliable way.
At the end of the day, we received another request from student Esteban Vargas to join the team, which we accepted in the same way.
